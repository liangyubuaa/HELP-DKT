# Dataset
The original Python code files are compressed in the path: `./Data/Original_Codes.zip`. Please unzip it.

```
unzip ./Data/Original_Codes.zip
```

Our dataset includes 9119 source codes collected from a Python Programming Introductory course hosted in a MOOC platform for learning a variety of programming languages.

Each Python file in the dataset directory represents a student's submission, and the name of the file is organized as follows:

1. the result of submission(**'b'** for buggy, **'c'** for correct)
2. the challenge number of submission(e.g. '362', '371')
3. the student ID
4. the number of student's submissions on one challenge

## Example

Consider one submission 'b_362_27176_2'. The example represents:
1. 'b': buggy, the submission is error
2. '362': the challenge number is 362
3. '27173': the student ID is 27173
4. '2': the Python file is the student's second submission for the challenge

Another example 'c_449_27303_5':
1. 'c': correct, the submission is correct
2. '449': the challenge number is 449
3. '27303': the student ID is 27303
4. '5': the Python file is the student's 5th submission for the challenge

### Challenge

In our paper, we use 'C-1', 'C-2', ... , 'C-6' to represent the challenges instead of '362', '449',... , '472' for clarity. The following table shows the comparison relationship:

| Paper name | Original name |
| --- | --- |
| C-1 | 362 |
| C-2 | 371 |
| C-3 | 406 |
| c-4 | 417 |
| c-5 | 449 |
| c-6 | 472 |

# HELP-DKT Model

N.B. if you do not want to reproduce generating the program vector embeddings, you can start here to run the HELP-DKT model using the embedding results in [Program_Vector_Embeddings.CSV](Data/Program_Vector_Embeddings.CSV).
